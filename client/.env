# ## **üîπ How Our Clients Get WhatsApp Business API Instantly**
# We provide a seamless onboarding experience where businesses can set up WhatsApp API **directly from our platform** with just a few clicks.

# ### **Step 1: One-Click Authentication for Clients**  
# When a **client** wants to connect their WhatsApp Business Account (WABA), they simply:  
# ‚úÖ Click a button on **our platform**.  
# ‚úÖ Get redirected to **Meta‚Äôs authentication page**.  
# ‚úÖ Approve the necessary permissions.  

# üëâ **Our system will then securely retrieve their API credentials (Access Token, Business ID, Phone Number ID).**  

# #### **üìå Redirect URL for Client Authentication**
# We use **Meta OAuth Login** to authenticate the client‚Äôs business automatically.

# ```
# https://www.facebook.com/v18.0/dialog/oauth?
#   client_id={APP_ID}&
#   redirect_uri={OUR_REDIRECT_URL}&
#   scope=whatsapp_business_management,whatsapp_business_messaging,business_management
# ```
# üîπ **OUR_REDIRECT_URL** ‚Üí This is our backend endpoint that processes authentication and onboarding.  

# ‚úÖ **Once the client approves, we automatically receive an authorization code.**  

# ---

# ### **Step 2: Gaining Full API Access to Manage Their WhatsApp Business**
# Once the **client** grants permissions, our system **exchanges the authorization code for an access token**.

# #### **üìå Get Long-Lived Access Token**
# ```
# GET https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/oauth/access_token?
#   client_id={APP_ID}&
#   client_secret={APP_SECRET}&
#   redirect_uri={OUR_REDIRECT_URL}&
#   code={AUTHORIZATION_CODE}
# ```
# ‚úÖ **This access token allows our platform to fully manage their WhatsApp Business API.**  

# #### **üìå Get Their Meta Business ID**
# To manage the client‚Äôs business, we retrieve their **Meta Business ID**:
# ```
# GET https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/me/businesses
# Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}
# ```
# ‚úÖ **This allows us to automate the entire onboarding process for them.**  

# ---

# ### **Step 3: Register the Client‚Äôs WhatsApp Business API Account (WABA)**
# If the client does not have an existing **WhatsApp Business API Account**, our system **automatically creates one**.

# ```
# POST https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/{BUSINESS_ID}/whatsapp_business_accounts
# Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}
# ```
# ‚úÖ **Now, the client‚Äôs WhatsApp Business API account is ready!**  

# ---

# ### **Step 4: Business Verification Assistance for Clients**
# Most businesses need to **verify their Meta Business Account** before they can use WhatsApp API fully. Our system **automates this process** for them.

# #### **üìå Check Business Verification Status**
# Before requesting verification, we check if the client‚Äôs business is already verified.
# ```
# GET https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/{BUSINESS_ID}?fields=verification_status
# Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}
# ```
# ‚úÖ **If the business is unverified, we proceed with verification.**  

# #### **üìå Submit Business Verification Automatically**
# ```
# POST https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/{BUSINESS_ID}/verifications
# Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}
# Content-Type: application/json
# {
#   "verification_type": "business"
# }
# ```
# ‚úÖ **Our system will now initiate the verification process on behalf of the client.**  

# üîπ **What Our Clients Need to Provide for Verification?**  
# - **Business Registration Documents**  
# - **Tax or Utility Bill** (showing the business name)  
# - **Website & Public Information**  

# üëâ **Once verified, their WhatsApp Business API access is fully enabled.**  

# ---

# ### **Step 5: Register the Client‚Äôs WhatsApp Business Number**
# Once the **client‚Äôs business is verified**, we **automatically register their phone number** to use WhatsApp Business API.

# ```
# POST https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/{WABA_ID}/phone_numbers
# Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}
# Content-Type: application/json
# {
#   "cc": "91",
#   "phone_number": "9876543210",
#   "verified_name": "Client's Company Name"
# }
# ```
# ‚úÖ **WhatsApp sends an OTP to the registered phone number for verification.**  

# ---

# ### **Step 6: Automatic Webhook Configuration for Clients**
# After registration, we **automatically configure webhooks** so that messages sent to the client‚Äôs WhatsApp number can be processed by their chatbot.

# ```
# POST https://graph.facebook.com/v18.0/{APP_ID}/subscriptions
# Authorization: Bearer {ACCESS_TOKEN}
# Content-Type: application/json
